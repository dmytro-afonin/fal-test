# CODEOWNERS file
# This file defines code owners for different parts of the repository.
# When enabled in branch protection rules, pull requests require approval
# from code owners before they can be merged.
#
# Syntax: <pattern> <owner1> <owner2> ... <ownerN>
# Patterns follow gitignore syntax
# Owners can be GitHub usernames or team names (prefixed with @)
#
# Example:
# * @username
# /app/ @team-frontend
# /lib/ @username @username2
# *.ts @team-typescript

# Default owners for all files
# Replace @your-username with your actual GitHub username or team
* @your-username

# Specific paths can have different owners
# Uncomment and customize as needed:

# API routes
# /app/api/ @your-username

# Database scripts
# /scripts/*.sql @your-username

# Configuration files
# *.json @your-username
# *.ts @your-username
# *.tsx @your-username

# Documentation
# *.md @your-username
